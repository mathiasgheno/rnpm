# React with No Package Manager

This is a React Project that does not use any Package Manager (Like NPM, PNPM, Yarn) to create a simples React Playground. Open the file `index.html` in your Browser and you can start playing. 

This project is not supposed to be used in a production environment and this template provides the very basic for you: like JSX sintax, Components, State and Props. This is not supposed to support Image, CSS and SVGs imports and ES6 Modules. For that you can use Webpack and others.
